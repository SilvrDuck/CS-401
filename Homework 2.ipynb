To avoid this issue, we simply replace each of this term by a integer (that would not make many difference when we compute the distance between two words)\n",
    " - Then, we mapped this stripped name from one dataframe to the stripped names of the other dataframe, the first thing is to look for exact matches (and there are many of them), then we use the `difflib.get_close_matches` function to retrieve the closest match. Unfortunately we had lot's of mismatches and this is why we decided to do a reverse matching.\n",
