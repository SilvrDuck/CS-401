# Impact of tourism on major cities

## Abstract

Some cities attract a lot of tourism. On the one hand, this influx can help
cities grow and profit to the community. On the other hand, citizens often
complain about gentrification and loss of identity. The debate is often founded
on feeling and belief. Although this is a valid way of debating about it, we
want to unravel the numerous factors of influence related to tourism in order
for people to forge their own philosophical thoughts based on factual data.
There is a huge variety of segments that could be explored in this domain. We
will restrict our scope to Airbnb and how its usage correlates with diverse
indicators in the city.

We decided to explore this by using data from AirBnB, from them we will be able
to compare data between cities but also see the evolution through time.

We will also restrict our research to two cities, Berlin and Amsterdam because there
exists a lot of data about them and so that we can be more thorough in our
analysis.

## Research questions

Each question will be answered for the two chosen cities, and compared:

 - is there a correlation between Airbnb usage and housing price ?
 - is there a correlation between Airbnb usage and economic growth ?
 - Influence of different bills on the usage of the service (e.g. introduction
    of maximum subletting time in Berlin)

## Dataset

 - http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html contains dataset taken from AirBnb
     the past few years for some cities Wikipedia (find general informations about
     cities: number of inhabitant, tourist per year). The datasets regarding the cities of interest are quite big.
 - http://tour-pedia.org/about/datasets.html data about points of interest and housing in different countries. Might be useful to look at how hotels compare to Airbnb.
 - https://www.govdata.de/ More data about Germany. Some data in here might be useful to develop more about Berlin.
 – https://data.overheid.nl/ More data about the Netherlands. We can use it to enrich data about Amsterdam.

## Internal milestones up until project milestone 2

 - Wisely select the cities we want to work on (probably Berlin as the first
     city, because of its size and the amount of data available, but we still
     need to select the second one, currently we are thinking about Amsterdam since it’s a highly touristic place with different problematic with respect to Berlin)

 - Limit the scope of the project (there are A LOT of data we could link to
     tourism and AirBnB data, for instance, we could compare the occupancy and
     the price to the weather, to major international event, ...) we need to
     define a limit to the scope of this project not to get lost.
