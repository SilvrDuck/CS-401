    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The massive adoption of the Airbnb service in the world has changed the way people travel, and how the hotel industry works. There is a lot of controversy about this service. The City of Berlin chose to ban the service entirely, and later made exception allowing people having only a secondary residency there to rent it, but for a limited amount of time per year. In the case of Amsterdam, a deal has been made directly with the company to limit the number of days that any given apartment can be rented.\n",
    "\n",
    "But what are the concerns here? Is it the hotel industry that suffers? Are the denizens of those cities directly threatened by rises in housing prices and speculation? In this work, we want to explore the data offered by the website http://insideairbnb.com/. We will try not to take any conclusion beforehand and simply try to find correlation between the usage of the housing service and different indicators published by the national statistics service themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "We chose to do those analysis on the two aforementioned cities, Berlin and Amsterdam, since they are both major touristic capitals in Europe, and quite close to each other. Comparing the two might help us have more insight on the effect of the business. The two cities have put in place major regulation on the service in 2016. We will therefore compare analyse the evolution of those factor between 2015 and 2017."
